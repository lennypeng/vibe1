This repository contains a simple browser-based Snake game located in the `snake` directory.

## Running the game

Open `snake/index.html` in any modern web browser. Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Refresh the page to restart after a game over.

## Testing

Run `./test.sh` from the repository root. It verifies the game loads over a
local HTTP server and checks `snake/snake.js` for syntax errors.
